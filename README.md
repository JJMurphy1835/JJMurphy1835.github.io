## About the Project  

Māori Lore and Law have shaped Aotearoa’s history for centuries. This project explores the balance between:  

- **Māori Lore (Tikanga)** – Traditional customs, spiritual beliefs, and values.  
- **Māori Law** – The impact of colonization, Te Tiriti o Waitangi (Treaty of Waitangi), and modern statutes.  
- **Māori Land & Governance** – Including *Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993* and Māori Incorporations.  

This repository serves as a **knowledge hub**, offering resources, research, and discussions on how Māori traditional laws continue to influence modern legal frameworks.

## Māori & European History  

### **He Whakaputanga o te Rangatiratanga o Nu Tireni (1835)**  

In 1835, Māori rangatira (chiefs) signed the **Declaration of Independence**, *He Whakaputanga*, asserting their sovereignty. This was recognized by the British Crown and protected by King William IV.

### **Te Tiriti o Waitangi (1840)**  

Five years later, the **Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti)** was signed between the British Crown and Māori chiefs. The Māori version emphasized **partnership and protection**, but the English version led to **colonization and land confiscations**. This treaty remains central to modern Māori-Crown relations.

### **The New Zealand Wars (1845–1872)**  

After the Treaty, conflicts erupted over land and sovereignty. These wars, known as the **New Zealand Wars**, saw Māori resistance against European military forces and unjust land confiscations. The impact of these wars continues to shape Māori rights and legal battles today.
