## 📖 About the Project  

Māori Lore and Law have shaped Aotearoa’s history for centuries. This project explores the balance between:  

🌿 **Māori Lore (Tikanga)** – Traditional customs, spiritual beliefs, and values.  
⚖️ **Māori Law** – The impact of colonization, Te Tiriti o Waitangi (Treaty of Waitangi), and modern statutes.  
🏡 **Māori Land & Governance** – Including **Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993** and Māori Incorporations.  

This repository serves as a **knowledge hub**, offering resources, research, and discussions on how Māori traditional laws continue to influence modern legal frameworks.

## 🛡️ Māori & European History  

### **📜 He Whakaputanga o te Rangatiratanga o Nu Tireni (1835)**  

In 1835, Māori rangatira (chiefs) signed the **Declaration of Independence**—**He Whakaputanga**—asserting their sovereignty. This was recognized by the British Crown and protected by King William IV.

### **⚖️ Te Tiriti o Waitangi (1840)**  

Five years later, the **Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti)** was signed between the British Crown and Māori chiefs. While the Māori version emphasized **partnership and protection**, the English version led to **colonization and land confiscations**. This treaty remains central to modern Māori-Crown relations.

### **⚔️ The New Zealand Wars (1845–1872)**  

Following the Treaty, conflicts erupted over land and sovereignty. These wars, known as the **New Zealand Wars**, saw Māori resistance against European military forces and unjust land confiscations. The legacy of these conflicts continues to impact Māori rights today.
